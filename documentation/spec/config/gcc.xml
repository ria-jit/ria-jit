<!-- This flags file is both an example for the SPEC CPU(R) 2017 documentation and a useful flags file for results with GCC.

................ You will want a nice wide window when reading this file ........................................................ 

     The first three lines at the top must be exactly as shown.  They claim that the file conforms to the DTD (Document Type
     Description) at the listed URL.  Results submitted to SPEC must use a well-formed flags file.  You can check your XML using
     a validating parser such as RXP, http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~richard/rxp.html, also included in your kit as 'specrxp'.  See:
         http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/utility.html#specrxp.
     Or, you can use an on-line parser, such as: 
         http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~richard/xml-check.html
         http://validator.w3.org/

     When results are displayed at www.spec.org, the XML file is transformed to HTML (using 'flags_dump', which is on your kit).
     You should ALSO validate the HTML version, which can be done at:
        http://validator.w3.org/

<!-- filename   http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#filename
                A complete (.rsf) result includes one or more embedded flags files.  When an embedded flags file is extracted, it 
                will need a name.  The next line tells the tools what name to use when extracting.  -->

<!-- title    http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#title
              All flag descriptions MUST have a title.  It'll be used as the page title for the full HTML version, and as for 
              page headings in HTML reports.  -->

              for elements in your flag descriptions, you may put it here.  As the contents should be HTML, it will save lots of
              time to just enclose the whole thing in a CDATA section.  See:

   <p>SPECrate runs might use one of these methods to bind processes to specific processors, depending on the config file.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><p>Linux systems: the <samp>numactl</samp> command is commonly used.     Here is a brief guide to understanding the specific
            command which will be found in the config file: </p>
         <ul>
            <li>syntax: <samp>numactl [--interleave=nodes] [--preferred=node] [--physcpubind=cpus] [--cpunodebind=nodes]
                  [--membind=nodes] [--localalloc] command args ...</samp></li>
            <li><samp>numactl</samp> runs processes with a specific NUMA scheduling or memory placement policy.  The policy is set for a
               command and inherited by all of its children. </li>
            <li><samp>--localalloc</samp> instructs numactl to keep a process memory on the local node while <samp>-m</samp> specifies which node(s) to
               place a process memory.  </li>
            <li><samp>--physcpubind</samp> specifies which core(s) to bind the process. In this case, copy 0 is bound to processor 0
               etc.</li>
            <li> For full details on using numactl, please refer to your Linux documentation, <samp>man numactl</samp></li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>Solaris systems: The <samp>pbind</samp> command is commonly used, via  
            <br /> <b><kbd>submit=echo 'pbind -b...' > dobmk; sh dobmk</kbd></b> <br />
            The specific command may be found in the config file; here is a brief guide to understanding that command: </p>
         <ul>
            <li><kbd><b>submit=</b></kbd> causes the SPEC tools to use this line when submitting jobs.</li>
            <li><kbd><b>echo ...&gt; dobmk</b></kbd> causes the generated commands to be written to a file, namely
               <kbd>dobmk</kbd>.</li>
            <li><p><kbd><b>pbind -b</b></kbd> causes this copy's processes to be bound to the CPU specified by the expression that
                  follows it.  See the config file used in the run for the exact syntax, which tends to be cumbersome because of
                  the need to carefully quote parts of the expression.  When all expressions are evaluated, the jobs are typically
                  distributed evenly across the system, with each chip running the same number of jobs as all other chips, and each
                  core running the same number of jobs as all other cores.  </p>
               <p>The pbind expression may include various elements from the SPEC toolset and from standard Unix commands, such
                  as:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><kbd><b>$BIND</b></kbd>: a reference to a value from the bind line, a line of the form
                     "<samp>bind&nbsp;=&nbsp;n&nbsp;n&nbsp;n&nbsp;n</samp>", where each "n" is a processor number.  See <a
                        href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/config.html#bind">http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/config.html#bind</a>
                     for details on this feature.</li>
                  <li><kbd><b>$$</b></kbd>: the current process id</li>
                  <li><kbd><b>$SPECCOPYNUM</b></kbd>: the SPEC tools-assigned number for this copy of the benchmark.</li>
                  <li><kbd><b>psrinfo</b></kbd>: find out what processors are available</li>
                  <li><kbd><b>grep on-line</b></kbd>: search the <kbd>psrinfo</kbd> output for information regarding on-line cpus</li>
                  <li><kbd><b>expr</b></kbd>: Calculate simple arithmetic expressions.  For example, the effect of binding jobs to a
                     (quote-resolved) expression such as: <br /><samp>expr ( $SPECCOPYNUM / 4 ) * 8 + ($SPECCOPYNUM % 4 ) )</samp>
                     <br />would be to send the jobs to processors whose numbers are:
                     <br /><samp>0,1,2,3, 8,9,10,11, 16,17,18,19 ...</samp></li>
                  <li><kbd><b>awk...print \$1</b></kbd>: Pick out the line corresponding to this copy of the benchmark and use the CPU
                     number mentioned at the start of this line.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><kbd><b>sh dobmk</b></kbd> actually runs the benchmark.</li>
      </ul></li>

   <p>One or more of the following may have been used in the run.  If so, it will be listed in the notes sections.  Here

   <ul>

      <li><p><b><kbd>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;directories&gt;</kbd></b>  (set via config file <samp>preENV</samp>)
            <br />LD_LIBRARY_PATH controls the search order for libraries.  Often, it can be defaulted.  Sometimes, it is

     flag       http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#flag
                Descriptions of flags start here and continue to the end of the file.
                We begin with flags in the 'compiler' class, which get matched first.  
     ============================================================================================================================= 
-->

<!-- Our first example is more complicated than most (sorry - but we want this flag to get processed first.)  Its function is 
     to get rid of irrelevant detail about compiler paths, by matching them, and then throwing them away.

     flag name    http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#flag_name
                  Each flag must have a unique name.  See additional discussion at flag 'gxx', below.

     flag class   http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#flag_class
                  Each flag must have a class.  See additional discussion of classes about 1 screenful further below.

     flag regexp  http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#flag_regexp
                  The regexp is how you teach the SPEC tools to find your flags.  This example matches:
                    - A path string that starts and ends with "/" containing only non-blank characters, followed by
                    - a compiler name: one of 'gcc', 'g++', or 'gfortran', followed by
                    - white space or end of string: http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#lookahead -->
<flag name="GCC_compiler_path_eater"
     class="compiler"
    regexp="\S+/(gcc|g\+\+|gfortran)(?=\s|$)">
   <!-- We are still defining our flag.  
        The opening tag had 3 attributes (name, class, regexp).  It has several more tags:
   -->
   <display enable="0" />  <!-- display        http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#display
                                               This causes the text that was matched to be thrown away and not reported.  (The
                                               text can nevertheless be reviewed, and will be, if you submit your result to SPEC
                                               for publication on its website.)
                           -->
   <include text="$1" />   <!-- include text   http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#include_text
                                               Wait, wait, we don't want to throw away everything; just the path.  The regexp
                                               captures the compiler name in $1; this line puts it back into the text stream. 
                           -->
   <example>/path/to/{gcc|g++|gfortran}</example>                  
                           <!-- example        http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#example 
                                               Although results do not include this flag (because display enable=0), we need to
                                               print *something* when doing a flags dump (i.e. HTML rendering of this XML file).
                                               The 'example' gives us that something.
                           -->
</flag>                    <!-- Done defining this flag -->


<!-- flag class   http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#flag_class
                  Every flag must have a class.  You can use 4 of them:

          class="compiler"       http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#compiler_class
                                 Invocation string for the compiler (example: 'gcc').  Other flags can be associated with a
                                 specific compiler using the compiler attribute. See the example below for flag '-g-gcc'.
                                 Compare the "compiler class" 
                                     vs. the "compilers attribute" at: 
                                 http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#compilers_attribute 
                               
          class="optimization"   http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#optimization
                                 A flag that affects performance (example: '-O3')
                               
          class="portability"    http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#portability
                                 A flag which SPEC has approved for portability use, or which you plan to ask SPEC to approve,
                                 prior to any public use of your results (example: '-DSPEC_LINUX').  See:
                                 http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/runrules.html#portability
                               
          class="other"           http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#other
                                  Anything else (example: '-v' to control verbosity)

     flag text    http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#flag_text
                  The flag below actually has a description!  At last, we start to accomplish what we came here to do: describe
                  flags.  Every flag must include descriptive text, except those that have 'display enable="0"'.  As the contents
                  should be HTML, it will save lots of time to just enclose the whole thing in a CDATA section.  See
                  http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#CDATA

<!-- flag name    http://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/flag-description.html#flag_name
                  The flag below is NOT given a name of 'g++'; instead we use 'gxx'.  The syntax rules for names are:
                   - Each flag must have a unique name.  
                   - A flag name must begin with a letter, a colon, or an underscore.  
                   - After that, it may be composed of letters, digits, periods, hyphens ('-'), underscores, or colons.  
                   - Therefore:
                      * Flag names cannot begin with a slash or hyphen ('/' or '-').
                      * Flag names cannot include an equals sign
                   - Search for 'DefaultRE' to see how to pick flag names that automatically imply commonly-useful regular
                     expressions to match them.

     All other flags are, for ease of maintenance, sorted into alphabetical order.  
     Sorting is alphabetical by the flag as used in compile commands, without regard to 
        - preceding punctuation
        - preceding 'no-'  (and -fno-mumble is alphabetized as -fmumble)
        - upper/lower case

                           Often, a regexp is not needed.  A name that starts with "F-" automatically gets a regexp to match 
                           everything after stripping the 'F'.   
                           In addition, the first (and only the first) colon ':' will be replaced by an equals sign '=' in the 
                           default regexp.  Thus the flag below matches '-fconvert=big-endian'.
